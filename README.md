# Gas Station Application

This is a simple gas station application built with **HTML and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
The application interacts with the user through browser dialogs and calculates the fuel cost based on the selected fuel type, fuel amount, and available balance.

All prices and calculations are handled in **USD**.

## Fuel Prices (per liter)

- Diesel: $1.24  
- Gasoline: $1.20  
- LPG: $0.66  

## How It Works

1. The user opens the application in a web browser.
2. A menu appears asking the user to select a fuel type.
3. The user enters the desired fuel amount in liters.
4. The user enters their current balance.
5. The application calculates the total cost.
6. If the balance is sufficient, the purchase is completed.
7. If not, the missing amount is displayed.
